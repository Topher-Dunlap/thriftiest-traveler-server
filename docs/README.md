## Open Endpoints
Open endpoints require no Authentication.

* [Login](login.md) : `POST /account/auth/login/`
* [Create Account](create.md) : `POST /account/create/`

### Deals and Events
Each endpoint manipulates or displays information from third part APIs that will be
attributed to the User signed in:

* [Events](events.md) : `GET /events/`
* [Deals](deals.md) : `GET /events/deals`

## Endpoints that require Authentication
Closed endpoints require a valid Token to be included in the header of the
request. A Token can be acquired from the Login view above.

### Saved
Each endpoint is related to the users saved flight deals.
* [Saved GET](savedGet.md) : `GET /events/saved/`
